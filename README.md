# Call Center AI Assistant Dashboard (Prototype)

This project provides a prototype of a real-time (segmented) call center AI assistant dashboard. It transcribes audio from a microphone and provides AI-generated suggestions for the agent's next response, all powered by local open-source models to ensure privacy and avoid API costs.

**Note:** This is a prototype. While it aims for near real-time suggestions, the transcription currently processes recorded segments after they are captured, rather than streaming word-by-word.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Microphone Audio Recording:** Capture audio directly from your browser's microphone.
* **Speech-to-Text (STT):** Transcribes recorded audio segments into text using a local Whisper model.
* **AI-Powered Suggestions:** Generates concise, actionable suggestions for call agents based on the transcript, using a local Large Language Model (LLM) via Ollama.
* **Frontend (React.js):** Intuitive user interface for recording and viewing transcripts/suggestions.
* **Backend (Flask):** Handles audio processing, STT, and communication with the local LLM.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **Frontend:**
    * React.js
    * Web Audio API (`MediaRecorder`)
* **Backend:**
    * Python 3
    * Flask
    * `openai-whisper`: For local Speech-to-Text inference.
    * `requests`: For communication with the local Ollama server.
* **Local LLM Runtime:**
    * [Ollama](https://ollama.com/): Runs large language models locally on your machine.
    * [Llama 3](https://ollama.com/library/llama3) (or other chosen LLM like Gemma, DeepSeek): The specific LLM model generating suggestions.
